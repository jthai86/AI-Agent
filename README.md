AI Coding Agent with Google Gemini (Python CLI Tool)
Built a command-line AI agent inspired by tools like Claude Code and Cursor, leveraging Google’s Gemini API to automate code editing and debugging workflows. This custom agent accepts natural language coding tasks (e.g., “fix my calculator app”), intelligently selects from a predefined function set, and iteratively works to resolve the issue.

Key Features:

Accepts plain-language coding tasks from the user via the terminal

Uses Google Gemini to decide which actions to take from a toolkit of predefined functions

Capable of scanning file directories, reading/writing code files, and running Python scripts

Repeats action cycles until the task is resolved or fails gracefully

Built using functional programming patterns in a multi-directory Python project

Tech Stack: Python 3.10+, Google Gemini API, CLI tools, uv package manager, Unix shell

This project demonstrates how to orchestrate AI decision-making by combining LLM capabilities with practical system-level actions. It emphasizes functional thinking, agent design, and API integration — skills highly relevant in modern AI-enhanced development workflows.
